Privacy Policy Tufa

At Tufa (the “App”), we value privacy as much as we value a fair coin toss. That means:

🔐We Don't Want Your Data. Seriously.​
We do not collect, store, or share any personal information.
We do not require login, registration, or DNA samples.
The app runs entirely on your device. No cloud, no spying satellites.
We don’t track your location — we barely know where we are.
We do not use cookies, unless they're chocolate chip (and even then, we ask).
We do not display ads or use third-party analytics. We’re too lazy for that.

🤝Our Commitment to You

Your data is your business. We don’t touch it.

What happens in your phone, stays in your phone.

If in the future we add features that collect data, you’ll be the first to know — like, with real words and clear choices.

Stay private, stay random. 🪙
